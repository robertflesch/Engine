Oculus Rift DK2 in retail box. (Adult owned, Excellent condition.)

This Oculus DK2 is practically brand new as it has only been used on 3 different occasions. I bought it while I was in graduate school and only had time to play with it for a few hours. I boxed it back up and didn't open it again until several months later when I let my daughter play Minecraft with it(which was an amazing experience). The last time I used it was a few days ago to verify that it was in perfect working order since school loans came due and I need the money. It is still in the retail box with original packaging minus the HDMI to DVI converter. I have no idea where that thing is. Happy bidding and I hope you use it the way it is meant to be used.

Selling my Oculus rift DK2. Perfect working condition. It's been used less than 10 times, mostly for getting my feet wet into VR. The experience has been great ever since SDK 8.0. Very easy to set up on windows 10 to get started.
