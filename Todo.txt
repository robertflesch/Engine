Platform Settings
need to define SDK as air_sdk
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download-win.html

next to go to Project Tab
select SDK
compiler output = c:\dev\kahoots\bin

now go to modules page
click + for new module, now import the kahootsapp.iml
now you have to go to each module and set the dependnacy

These are something we should move toward over time, any new code should meet this format

VoxelVerse

<1 voxels shows, but infinite amount
the edit cursor is not always showing up in correct spot
ambient occulsion is broken
glass draws both sides - pass flag in shader? backside doesnt work until alpha is sorted properly
lights don't work
when switched to other tabs and then when I came back it would only let me move with Wasda and not change angle
