VoxelVerse todo

Recipes.. do I copy them to users inventory? or just give him reference?
Copy of Avatar when starting
Promotion system
FB integration?
Payvault integration?

Lower
Avatar is saving every time, what has set changed to true
need to display ammo for gun models in voxel model panel - Or just allow infinity ammo
HashTag not set in import
SoundRange not set on import?
dynamic lighting on all of dragon
engine block on zeppelin does not light correctly 3.29.17
if model is deleted from region models, the animation and script panels are not updated.
adding -inline to the release compiler options causes function initializeDataBeforeSplash() to throw exceptions
check collision for objects, make sure they are not all check everything every frame. Only selected object should do that, or ones that have collision.
could use a bitmapdisplacement filter on water overlay to give it the moving water effect.
need to add clipVelocity and speedMultiplier to animation editor
When deleting a model that has inventory, make sure to delete its inventory.
Language Manager sometimes does not find file, DefaultProviderManager - loadFail line 110, how to inform app and what to do?

UI Bugs to be fixed after moving to TypeScript
The "Edit Data" button on the model inventory needs to be a MapAreaButton(triangular). Otherwise clicks on on transparent part of button get intercepted.

--Collision
Camera needs to collide with world!
When side of the avatar is touching an oxel it get pushed up over and over again.
what happens to vines when sub oxels are created?

DONE - make sure model inventory gets reset
DONE - make sure duplicated model gets added to inventory window
DONE - make sure permissions are correct on duplicated model.
DONE - Do modify check on model







! 12.1.16 need to add clipVelocity and speedMultiplier to rest of the animations, and to the setState, so that they are not hard coded.
! 12.4.16 static lighting on head of dragon



SETUP NOTES
I had to modified the 
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\FlashPlayerTrust\tw_encyclopedia_trust.cfg
to which I added E:\dev\VoxelVerse\
this allowed me to import assets

What is VoxelVerse.

My goal is to create a browser based AR platform where everyone is able to create, explore, and share 3D voxel models, games, adventures.
User created content
User rated content
User sellable content
AI powered NPC's
User created regions, models, animations, adventures
PvP action in Zeppelins, Dragons, etc
Destruction of other users content (temp or perm?)
PvP area's are buildable and destructable, private or shared common area's require permission.
New adventures created by user everyday
Very low cost per user.
Anything is destructable
User friendly, 


1 What is VoxelVerse

VoxelVerse is a 3D content and game generation tool for everyone.

2) How big is the market?

The market is currently worth around 200 million per year. 
But we see that expanding to over 1 billion per year over the next 5 years.

3) Whats your progress?

The content generation tool is complete along with the majority of the UI.
The server technology is functional

4) What's your unique insight?

Content needs to be democratized
While 3D mesh models are pretty, only professionals can create them, this limits content creation to 0.0001% of people.
After running 3D mesh worlds for 10 years, I came to apprecaite the power of user generated content.

5) Whats my business model?

Freemium - anyone can use, create, and explore for free. But to sell, expand your creations, speed your exploration, you have to spend.

6) Who's on my team?

This project has been a solo, part time interest for a number of years.
Now I am at a point where the core functionality has been proven, and needs to be expanded to include more team members.

7. What do you want?

I am looking for a 500k seed investment.
