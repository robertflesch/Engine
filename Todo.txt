Where do I start?

Known Issues
Movement
	When jump and getting bounce from auto jump, you can just too high
	Camera needs to collide and adjust view distance if in third person view
	Edit cursor is not always in correct spot when in first person view
Model placement
	The default screen shot of new models is has to be hand made.
	When you place a model, you can not stack another on top of it. It needs to have a placeholder inserted into the oxel. --/partial fix
	Dynamic lighting on placed child models is not correct.
	Object editing inside holes of other objects not correct
	when a flow oxel is flowing and the oxel height is less then 100%, if you select a smaller cursor size, then seemly empty oxels are highlighted
GUI
	The close icon sometimes acts as acancel, other times as a save.
	App does not get focus when starting, so I have to click it to use enter key to log in.
Oxel
	Water edges don't allow merge perfectly

GENERAL CRITICAL:
IMPLEMENT: MODEL PLACEMENT
TODO: Child parts are loading in general inventory, is that desirable?
IMPLEMENT: CIRCULAR MODEL LOADING BREAK.
IMPLEMENT: LOD
IMPLEMENT: BURNING MATS
IMPROVE: Lava Flow should stop at X when flowing straight down? Break into rock emitter?
IMPROVE: Water Flow should stop at X when flowing straight down? Break into mist and then mist emitter?
TODO: Camera collision - ideally the camera will want to go back to its default distance and height, but collision with things around it can cause it to move closer to avatar at minimum, and ideally to move up and closers as needed
FIX: When collide is off, if you hit space bar and collide with stuff, it throws you way up in sky
TODO: Backside of water oxels
TODO: Fix fire animation around wood so that it can work with any voxel. Is it a double voxel? Is there a limit to the amound of faces an oxel can have?
TODO: Limit camera angle when in first person?

NICE TO HAVE:
NEED: Friends list for adding editor
TODO: Head needs to turn up and down with camera.
IDEA: Glass, have engine use ambientOcclusion data to draw edges around glass, if edge value for a side >= 1 then draw border.
IDEA: VertexManager sharing, this would allow us to have multiple creatures on the screen, just using one vertexManager

MODELS
Possible issue. Lets say dragon has a right wing tip, I delete that from the dragons right wing. Under what circumstance, if any, do I delete that from persistance?
ZEPPELIN
TODO: Add new hud
TODO: Add ammo store and ammount
TODO: Add particles to cannon fire

CANNON
TODO - MINOR: Break the ammo description out into its own json file for reuse.

PARTICLE
TODO: All(Many) particles should share the same vertex manager, and maybe a modified rendering loop?

DRAGON
IMPROVE: Dragon: Needs idle animation, being stopped plays walk animation now
IMPROVE: Dragon: Needs walk animation
TODO:  Dragon: Dragon fire should only melt an oxel for a few turns, then it turns back solid. And when it flows, it doesnt leave anything behind.
FIX: Give each breath its own sound
FIX: When dragon hits something, it pops to the top of object
FIX: After landing goes back to flying too easy.
IMPROVE: Dragon: Starts going TOO fast when diving (really just moving forward).
IMPROVE: Pops between states (?) after landing
FIX: If you get on and off multiple times, the avatar angle gets off.

GUI WindowVoxelModel
TODO: Be nice if selected model was somehow highlighted. And camera faced it
TODO: Deleting objects from a region should put them into your inventory? Other option is to remove them permanently from BigDB

NEW REGION WINDOW:
ADD: Sky color
ADD: GuestAllowed


EMITTER
TODO: Create emitter manager and emitter class to use in showing splash, mist, fire, etc

WATER
FIX: Water not lighting correctly
FIX: Faces getting generated for when larger water oxel is next to smaller solid oxel
TODO: Water faces next to solid should be inverted, arg, how does this work with FIX above? have to split oxel?
ADJUST: Water speed.


LIGHTING 
STATIC
FINISH: WORKING - directional component of lighting
FINISH: WORKING - per material attenuation
FIX: HOLD - Still bug in propogation by light enclousure
FIX: In ambient Occlusion - quads need to be flipped some times to show lighting correctly
DYNAMIC
TODO: Add lighting manager for dynamic lights, so the closest X lights can be retrived

RENDERING
IMPROVE: When adjusting screen size, the dispose/create cycle is called multiple times. Should only re-get context when mouse is released.

////////////////////////////////////////////

IDEA: FOG
IDEA: How can I add voxel models as voxels? e.g. I torch is really voxel model, but it would be handy to have it as just a voxel(oxel). Solution: Add a model manager, that would add in torch models where ever the lights were.
IDEA: Low Prioity - Have clouds flow like a liquid
IDEA: Nice to be able to toggle autoflow
IDEA: Nice to be able to cancel flow and light tasks
IDEA: Great mini game, stop the water that is flowing into the town! Watch alexa trying to stop it was SO funny.
IDEA: Break out contour from flow, so any block can contour (like grass)
IDEA: Glass voxel are full bright
IDEA: on ambient occlusion, if neighbor is larger...
IDEA: on ambient occlusion, if neighbor is smaller...

Ageing System for Oxels: Quicksand to sand, mud to dirt, laval to stone.


////////////////////////////////////////////
COMPLETED
REENABLE: Saving on the network.
FIX: Dragon: Wings not right after taking off
FIX: Dragon Fire breath uses RED, yuck! Change to Lava or Fire
FIX: Lagging after hitting dragon breath on stone
FIX: Particles should be UNLIT, not lights
TODO: I notice a large frame rate hit the frame after I redraw a bunch of oxels, what give?
TYPEINFO: Add an fullbright flag to types.
FIX: Lights not spreading correctly
DONE: Lights below 1 meter dont work correctly
DONE: Arm on left with torch is annoying - clear view
DONE: Head voxel are annoying - clear view
DONE: Torch on and off!
FIX: Change the model for dragon breath so its not cannon
FIX: Torch attachment to hand doesnt dispose correctly
FIX: Dispose on torch attachment is cause exception
FIX: Mouse lock in full screen doesnt allow you to use GUI at all.
IMPROVE: She wants fullbright, any color
FIX - MINOR: Oxels appear to not already being removed. I just saw a oxel with no quads in addComponentData
FIX: Nice to have an indication of which model is selected.
FIX: Intertra translucent membranes showing on wings
FIX: When I change a model, do all the models change, or is a new instance created? not clearly in one of the other situations right now.
FIX: Toolbar loses pictures of model when loading.

PlayerIO
SFTP password = redparrotSFTP
FB bought Oculus

they obviously have desire to be part of the Virtual World(Reality) scene
I think VoxelVerse, has a chance to be big in both of those markets
FB is popular amongst the oldER crowds these days, less to amongst the younger crowd
so VoxelVerse would give them a good destination for the millions of kids playing MC

Since VoxelVerse is browser based users could display on FB the models they had created and get likes, etc
This is also good since VoxelVerse is model based
 as opposed to MC which is really just one big world
 Also VV can work with Oculus Rift, on Desktops initially, but could migrate to mobile
 I designed it to be mobile friendly, and Flash can compile to mobile targets
 plus, VV is a combination of a building expereince, exploration, and PVP (and PVE)
 so it has a lot of stickiness

Virtual Goods market 4.1 billion
http://research.gigaom.com/report/the-evolution-of-the-virtual-goods-market/
Virtual Reality market 5.2 billion by 2018
http://www.kzero.co.uk/blog/consumer-virtual-reality-market-worth-13bn-2018/

Weaknesses:
Single person studio
Limited marketing connection
No testing at scale yet
some dependancy on online service providers (player.io aka yahoo game network)

Opportunities
Minecraft exposed a 250 (2.5 billion) million opportunity which could be a billion dollar opportunity
steam punk space under targeted.

Threats
While other next generation voxel engines exist. None are targeted toward this space currently.
